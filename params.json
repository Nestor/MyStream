  "body": "### Welcome\r\nMyStream is an open source streaming backend (along with its own theme), for you to host your own streaming website, or even your own portfolio website to show off your videos!\r\n\r\nMyStream is also amazingly powerful giving you a lot of flexibility with a very easy configuration, there is no other script like it (well not free anyway).\r\n\r\n### Updates to Come\r\nWe know that as time goes by, more users will want more features, that's why we've planned a few updates in advanced, well at least the features that are going to come with them:\r\n*  User Login System with Recently Watched\r\n*  Better Design\r\n*  Better 3rd Party Theme Integration\r\n*  Enhanced administrator panel loading (Loads everything in one go so when you switch between pages, the script wont verify you   again, meaning you have a quicker loading time | Also means when you switch pages there will be I think no wait time).\r\n*  Views System + Most Watched\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\nWell if your eager to get started, you **need** these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Create a database and a user account to go with it, or you could use a master account.\r\n\r\n2. Edit the MySQL information in the config/configuration.php file to match.\r\n   -> `$serverip = \"localhost\";`<br>\r\n      `$username = \"root\";`<br>\r\n      `$password = \"root\";`<br>\r\n      `$dbname = \"mystream\";`<br>\r\n\r\n3. Edit the configuration file and put in the rest of the required values. \r\n\r\n4. Edit core/init.php AND ONLY CHANGE THE LINE: <br>\r\n`define(ROOT, $_SERVER[\"DOCUMENT_ROOT\"] . \"/Stream\"); // Edit the /stream part`<br>\r\nif you place the file in no folder, then get rid of /stream, if you placed it in a folder then do /foldername DO NOT LEAVE / AT THE END!<br>\r\n**Only edit the part /Stream !!!!**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@ExusVX\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nFound a bug or want a feature?
